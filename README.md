# C++ Playground

I'm making a half-hearted attempt to learn Modern C++ (tm). It turns out C++ has
changed a fair bit since I last used it in anger 15-odd years ago. Who knew? This
repository is intended to be a dumping-ground for my attempts at getting to grips
with the language in its current state. Please don't assume that the code will be
anything other than terrible.
