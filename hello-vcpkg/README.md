# hello-vcpkg

I finally got round to trying vcpkg. It seems quite nice. Makes pulling in dependencies almost as painless
as it is using gradle/gem/npm/leiningen etc.

So painless, in fact, that I'm finally playing with Boost. I might return to trying to do more of Advent 
of Code in C++ at this rate.
